        <p id = "bio"> 
            The Faslick Book Store was built in 1954 in Atco, NJ. The building of the Faslick Book Store was possible through a donation from a former Atco resident. Our purpose in selling books is to enrich the community with knowledge. Our bookstore also provides an atmosphere where like-minded individuals can come together and share new ideas through the books they have read. </p>
